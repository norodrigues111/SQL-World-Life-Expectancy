# World Life Expectancy Project
 Welcome to my portfolio repository showcasing my data cleaning project using MySQL. In this project, I've worked with World Life Expectancy data to clean and prepare it for analysis using MySQL queries.
 
Project Overview:
The World Life Expectancy dataset is a comprehensive collection of data related to life expectancy across different countries and regions. However, like many real-world datasets, it's messy and requires cleaning before it can be analyzed effectively.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to clean and structure the World Life Expectancy data using MySQL. By leveraging MySQL's powerful querying capabilities, I've transformed raw, messy data into a clean and structured format suitable for further analysis.

Key Features:
Utilized MySQL queries to clean, transform, and restructure the data.
Addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues in the dataset.
Created a well-organized and normalized database schema for efficient data management.
Documented the data cleaning process and SQL queries for transparency and reproducibility.
Contents:

SQL scripts: 
Contains the SQL scripts used for data cleaning and transformation.

Documentation: 
Detailed documentation outlining the data cleaning steps and explanations of SQL queries.
Sample data: A subset of the original dataset used for testing and demonstration purposes.

Usage:
Feel free to explore the SQL scripts and documentation to understand the data cleaning process. You can run the SQL scripts in your MySQL environment to replicate the data cleaning steps on your machine.
